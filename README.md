# ProgressInsight
### A simple JavaScript project that tracks the progress of any work by VISUALLY showing the percentage of work has already been completed and the percentages yet to be completed.
#### It is a progress bar which has 100 units each representing 1%. There are buttons to INCREASE, DECREASE and RESET the progress bar. Whenever the user accomplished a portion of his work, he may update the progress bar and observe visually how far he has came. 
#### This Project has 8 such progress bars for tracking eight types of work progress at a time. So, he can observe the growth in all aspects of his life in a single page.
